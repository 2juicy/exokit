## [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5)

HTML5 is the latest evolution of the standard that defines HTML. The term represents two different concepts. It is a new version of the language HTML, with new elements, attributes, and behaviors, and a larger set of technologies that allows the building of more diverse and powerful Web sites and applications. This set is sometimes called HTML5 & friends and often shortened to just HTML5.

## [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSS)

## [THREE.js](https://threejs.org/docs/)

Three.js is a cross-browser JavaScript library and Application Programming Interface (API) used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser. Three.js uses WebGL(see WebGL in Native APIs).

## [Express](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html)

## [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API)
WebSockets are an advanced technology that makes it possible to open an interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server. With this API, you can send messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without having to poll the server for a reply.

## [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)

The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources (including across the network). It will seem familiar to anyone who has used XMLHttpRequest, but the new API provides a more powerful and flexible feature set.

## [Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers)

Web Workers makes it possible to run a script operation in a background thread separate from the main execution thread of a web application. The advantage of this is that laborious processing can be performed in a separate thread, allowing the main (usually the UI) thread to run without being blocked/slowed down.
